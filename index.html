     </body> According to LAHSA, there were at least 63,706 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County in 2020. More than half of the entire homeless, unsheltered population in the United States are in California. Los Angeles’ homeless population is more than 5 times the California city with next highest homeless population. Even when looking at the rate of homeless people per 100,000 residents by city, LA makes it to number 2 on the list. It is undeniable that the homeless situation in Los Angeles is disproportionate to the rest of the United States, and something needs to be done. 
Several of the wealthiest cities in the US are also in California. For my field test, I could make a VR video that walks you through these two sides to California – walking through “tent cities” to the multimillion-dollar mansions around the corner that are so abundant in LA. This data will be useful to test if the VR creates more empathy than an article with data and charts. VR could humanize this data by putting faces to the numbers. Hopefully, humanizing the people behind the statistics could help the future of journalism by inspiring change and action to solve major problems in the world.</body>
